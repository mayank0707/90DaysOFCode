#LeetCode problem

Q.) Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target. (link- https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/)
Concept- Suppose arr[]={'c','e','g'};
         target='d'
         Answer should be 'e'.
         So used ceiling of a letter concept to find the answer just with one change that the equal comparison to target is removed according to the problem.
         
Solution- 

class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        int start=0;
        int n=letters.length;
        int end=n-1;
        while(start<=end){
            int mid=start+(end-start)/2;
            if(letters[mid]<=target){
                start=mid+1;
            }
            else if(letters[mid]>target){
                end=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return letters[start%n]; //For the letters wrap around case as well as Ceiling case is applied here.
    }
}
